                            Orginally from Wisconsin and now resisding in Minneapolis, I am a hard-working young professional with a passion for computer science in general and web devolopment in particular.  I have a broad background in both History (B.A. University of Minnesota) and in programming, as computer science was my minor.  I hope to utilize my diverse knowledge to contribute to projects that benefit the greater good as well as those that advance scientifically-minded goals.
                        </p>

                                In addition to my academic achievements, I have a long history of working with teams of people.  I've had nearly ten years of working in restaurants and in each of those roles I was tasked with both delegating and organizing responsibilities in order to meet our customers wishes.  I believe these people-orientated skills will drive me to understand my co-workers' strengths and greatly aid in my maturation in the field.
                        </p>

                                Outside of studying and work, I have many recreational pursuits.  I enjoy hiking, biking, and generally being outdoors.  When weather isn't permissive, I often work on my chess abilities and occasionally partake in a game of Magic the Gathering or the computer game Hearthstone. On the weekends I often meet with my friends for music or other cultural events.  I do my best to keep well rounded while away from the computer.

                                In total, I am very excited to begin my adventure in the world of web development and would love to hear from you if you have any questions or opportunites that I might be interested in.
